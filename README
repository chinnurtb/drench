drench sends out SYN packets to wherever you so desire, then ACK's the
SYN ACK's and keeps on keeping on ACK'ing all night long, baby.

The result is the poor destination service is overwhelmed with connections
and crashes, if per address limitations are not in play. And if such
limitations have wisely been enforced but the service happens to run on
the local network, drench is happy to spoof a whole bunch of addresses
to get around it.
